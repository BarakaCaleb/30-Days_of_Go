# 30 Days of Go Challenge

Welcome to the **30 Days of Go Challenge**! This repository is dedicated to documenting a structured, daily journey to mastering the fundamentals and core features of the Go programming language. Each day, we'll tackle new concepts, complete hands-on exercises, and work on small projects to progressively build our Go skills.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

This challenge is designed to help developers:
- **Build a daily coding habit** by engaging with Go programming every day.
- **Learn Go fundamentals** and move toward intermediate and advanced concepts.
- **Create practical mini-projects** to reinforce learning and apply new skills.
- **Collaborate and network** with others on a similar journey.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each day has its own folder containing:
- **Daily Challenge**: A small exercise or coding task focused on specific Go concepts.
- **Project Code**: Any relevant code files or mini-projects developed on that day.
